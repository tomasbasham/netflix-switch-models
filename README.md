# Netflix-switch-models

Stereolithography (STL) files for a Netflix Switch.

## Printing

The easiest possible way to get a copy of these models is to have a fabrication house do it for you. I have had an amazing experience using [3DHubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/) and highly recommend them. Simply upload the files to the website and they will print and ship them to you.

These files are also hosted on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1743817). Here you can skip the 3DHubs upload step with this [link](http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/3d-print-with-3d-hubs/run?thing_id=1743817/apps). However you will have a limited choice of colours and printers.
